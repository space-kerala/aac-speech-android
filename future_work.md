FUTURE WORK (A BIT OLD?)
-----------
* possibility to manually add words
* clean up the icon-set
    * see if better categorizations are possible
    * provide better part-of-speech tags
    * remove duplicate icons so that only best icons are selected for each word (currently any icon is selected)
* extend/improve natural language processing
    * automatic guessing, compound words: avoir besoin etc, add other question and negation types (ne..que, ne..guerre etc, in addition to ne .. pas)
* extend user interface
    * more options for word icons (e.g. overriding number/gender for each icon)
    * ~~better UI for tablets: have filtering options on the side of category view~~
* extend English functionality
* misc
    * could we further speed up the loading time?
    * Gesture search do not handle French accents yet (bug in Google's app) - currently we use the ascii version of French word for search
